# These are typically set automatically by Tauri CLI
# but can be overridden if needed

# TAURI_PLATFORM=macos

# Tauri family (unix, windows)
# TAURI_FAMILY=unix

# Debug mode (1 for debug, 0 for release)

# Note: VITE_API_URL is not needed in Tauri mode
# as it uses Tauri commands instead of REST API
